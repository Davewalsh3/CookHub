Features
I utilized the bootstrap grid feature to make the website responsive and structured on all devices and also implemented a reappearing Navbar on upscroll to navigate smoothly through the page. My webpage will consist of a top navbar, a search bar contained in here (non-functional) As a landing page, the Map and Jumbotron related to the website brand will appear first. Below the map, there will be numerous buttons sat atop picture/hyperlink buttons. The buttons will redirect the map to a city in the named country. The image/hyperlink below will redirect the user to third party package holiday company. By clicking on the 'Brand' on the navbar you will be redirected to the top of the page. This makes aceess to desired content instant and intuitive. A smooth scroll CSS function was applied for ease of use. The Navbar is available at all times when scrolling. The user is able to contact the website owner via an online form which redirects to a specified gmail account.
